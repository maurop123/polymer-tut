`from-scratch/` is where I try to use webcomponents from scratch with no framework (i.e. no polymer). It isn't working yet.

`polymer-tut` is where I'm following the polymer tutorial. I left off here: https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/start/first-element/step-3

You should have bower installed: `npm i -g bower`
